    "text": "Camera trap distance sampling (CTDS) is a relatively new application of distance sampling, using data from remotely-operated camera or video recorders. The methods are described by Howe et al. (2017). One important component of the analysis of camera trap distance sampling (CTDS) data is determining the proportion of animals that are active during the diurnal sampling window during which detections are counted. A tool to help with this is the activity package (Rowcliffe et al. 2014, Rowcliffe 2021) in the R software.\nWe have created a simple interface that allows web-based access to the core functionality of the activity package without the need to install R. Users can upload detection times from a text file, fit a probability density to the times, input the proportion of the day represented, and obtain activity values together with bootstrap estimates of uncertainty. Users can download the bootstrap results file. The activity value and bootstrap results file can then be imported into Distance for Windows for use in analysis of CTDS data.\nThe visual interface is built using the shiny package in R. It is made available here as a free service to distance sampling users. Please let us know if you have problems accessing it, or have suggestions for improvement.\nClick here to access the web-based interface to the activity package.\n\n\n\nHowe, E.J., S.T.

    "title": "Distance for Windows release notes",
    "section": "System Requirements for Distance 7.5",
    "text": "System Requirements for Distance 7.5\n\nOperating System and Hardware Requirements\nAny modern desktop PC will have no problem installing and running Distance 7.5. It requires about 90MB of space on your hard drive, and either Windows 7, 8 or 10 operating systems. (Distance will likely also run under older versions of Windows operating systems; however this is no longer actively supported. If you are using a legacy operating system, be aware that the practical minimum hardware requirements are a Pentium II Processor, 48MB RAM, 800x600 SVGA monitor with 256 colors.)\n\n\nR Statistical Software\nThree analysis engines and the simulation engine in Distance 7 are implemented as libraries in the free statistical software R. These are the Mark Recapture Distance Sampling (mrds), Density Surface Modelling (dsm), Multi-Analysis Distance Sampling (mads) and the Distance Sampling Simulations (dsims) libraries. If you would like to run any of these engines, you must install R software on your computer first. You can download R from the R Project web site, http://www.r-project.org/. You need the base precompiled binary distribution for Windows.\n\nThe R libraries in this version of Distance (7.5 release 2) were tested and compiled using R version 4.2.2. You will need to install this version of R and point Distance to it in the R Options after selecting the Preferences option from the Tools menu.\n\nPlease note that R is under very active development, and new versions are released quite frequently. Unfortunately, new versions are sometimes not compatible with libraries compiled in old versions. We will endeavor to test our libraries with each new version as it appears, and update are libraries as required. We will post any information we have about compatibility with new versions on the Distance-sampling email discussion list (see below), so please check there for latest information.\nYou can download and install R after you have installed Distance, and you can run Distance without having R installed - but you will get an error message if you try to run the MRDS, DSM, MA analysis engines or the simulation engine without R.\nFor more information about the R-Distance link, see the Distance online help, Chapter 7. There you will find a topic \"R Statistical Software\".\n\n\nWindows Script 5.6\nIf you are trying to run Distance with a legacy version of Windows (before Windows Vista) you may need to install Windows Script, if it is not already on your machine. The Distance installation program contains a copy of the English language verion of Windows Script 5.6, and you have the option to install this as part of the program setup. If you are using a non-English version of Windows, you will probably want to download and install the version of Windows Script appropriate for your language -- you can get this from http://www.microsoft.com/scripting/. If you have already installed the appropriate version of Windows Script on your computer, then you should say \"No\" when the Distance setup program asks you if you want to install its version.\n\n\nPDF file Reader\nThe Distance User’s Guide is also available in Adobe PDF format. To read this file (which is installed in the Distance/Help directory), you need software capable of reading PDF files. One example is Adobe Acrobat reader, available for free from http://www.adobe.com, but other free software is available.\n\nRunning Distance under other operating systems\nTo run Distance under non-Windows operating systems, a Windows emulator is required. For some tips, see the section on \"Running Distance on other operating systems\" at http://distancesampling.org/distanceextras.html.\n\n\nRunning Distance in extended character systems\nIf you use an extended character operating system (e.g., Chinese, Japanese or Korean language Windows) then you need to make the following change to the program preferences before you start using the program. Once you have installed Distance:\n\nStart Distance\nFrom the menu, choose Tools | Preferences...\nClick on the General tab. Un-tick the box \"Store results in compressed format in project databases\"\nClick OK.\n\nYou need to make this change because by default Distance compresses the results from analyses when it stores them in project databases, and at present it cannot decode these results on extended character operating systems.\nInstalling Distance under Windows\nThe Distance setup program has a filename of the form d[x]release[y].exe, where [x] is derived from the version number and y is the release number. Double-click on this file to run it. You are then guided through the installation. If you have an older operating system, you may be asked to re-boot again early in the installation process and then restart the install. You may also be asked to reboot after install has finished. You need to have administrator privileges to install Distance.\nOnce Distance is installed, you can run Distance 7 from the Programs | Distance 7 folder off the Start menu on your windows Taskbar.\nA list of the files added by Distance installation is given in Appendix 1.\n\n\n\nProblems with Install\nProblems encountered when installing Distance are recorded here: https://github.com/DistanceDevelopment/distance-bugs\nThe main installation issues encountered include conflicts with antivirus software and problems opening dlls. Conflicts with antivirus software can be resolved by temporarily disabling the antivirus software prior to installation. Issues relating to dll conflicts are more complicated, please contact us at distance@st-andrews.ac.uk and we will be happy to try to help you resolve the problem. We now build an alternative installer to try to get round these issues.\nAnother common issue is a warning produced by Windows Defender:\nWindows protected your PC Microsoft Defender SmartScreen prevented an unrecognized app from starting. Running this app might put your PC at risk.\nMore info\nWe are working on a resolution to this problem, but in the meantime please be assured that Distance is perfectly safe to install, and the following is a work-around to the error message.\n\nClick on the More info link.\nYou should see a button Run anyway.\nClick on the Run anyway button and the installation should proceed as normal.\n\nIf you are having a problem that is not listed there, please (1) check your computer meets the minimum requirements (above); (2) check the archives of the distance-sampling discussion list (see below); (3) look at the file C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Distance 7\\Install.log to see if it gives you any clues as to the problem; (4) contact the program authors by email: distance@st-andrews.ac.uk.\nSample Projects\nInformation on the sample projects is given in Chapter 2 of the online help.\nUpgrading from previous versions of Distance\nDistance 7.5 will install over any previous Distance 7.x installations, it is not necessary to remove these installations prior to installing Distance 7.5. Distance 7.5 will register itself to open .dst files when you double-click on them. If you open a Distance project created in a previous version, you will be asked if you wish to upgrade it, and if you say \"Yes\", Distance will perform the upgrade automatically.\nWhen upgrading Distance you should also upgrade to the recommended version of R. Failing to do so may mean that you continue using old versions of the R packages or the newer R packages may not work in the older version of R. Note that, to ensure that Distance installs the new R packages on the first run of an analysis that uses one of the R-based analysis engines, please take the following steps:\n\nChoose Tools | Preferences | R Options\nTick the box that says Re-install analysis / simulation engine libraries to original versions on the next run.\n\nNote also that to successfully upgrade the R packages when you run an analysis, all other instances of R need to be closed.\nYou are advised to re-run all analyses as the analysis engines are improved with each iteration of the software.\nIf you have a copy of Distance 6, 5, 4 or 3.5 on your machine, you don't have to uninstall it before installing Distance 7. Distance 7 will install into a different directory, and you can carry on using both the older and new version of the software if you wish. However, please note that if you upgrade a Distance project using Distance 7, you will not be able to open it in any of the previous versions. Should you wish to do this, you should copy the project before upgrading, so you can open the old files in the old version. One convenient way to copy a project from within Distance is to use File | Export project.\nPlease let us know if you have any problems transitioning to the new version of Distance.\nUninstalling Distance\nTo uninstall Distance, click on the Add/Remove Programs icon in the Windows Control Panel. Choose Distance 7 from the list and click the Add/Remove button. During the removal process, you will be asked whether you want to remove shared components. Press \"Yes to All\". The install program may not be able to remove all of the folders under C:\\Program Files\\Distance7\\ if you have changed any files in them (e.g., by creating new projects in \\Sample projects).

For an up to date list, and a list of known problems, please visit https://github.com/DistanceDevelopment/distance-bugs\nDistance 7.5 Release 2 - Uses latest version of R (4.2.2) with updated versions of dssd, dsims, Distance and mrds which have various bug fixes. Fix in dsims now allows for stratum level designs within simulations at the global level.\nDistance 7.5 Release 1 - Uses latest version of R (4.2.1) with updated versions of mrds, dsm and mads which have various bug fixes. In addition, the R package DSsim has been replaced with dsims. Includes an additional example project on the analysis of point transect removal method data. Fixed bug relating to renaming a new map before you have opened it.\nDistance 7.4 Release 2 - Uses R version of 4.1.2. This release has an important bug fix to correct the field names stored in the survey definition for cluster size, object, observer and detected. Anyone using these fields with projects created in Distance 7.4 release 1 should check they are correctly specified within the survey definition.\nDistance 7.4 Release 1 - Uses latest version of R (4.1.2) with updated versions of mrds, dsm, DSsim and mads which have various bug fixes.\nDistance 7.3 Release 2 - Uses latest version of R (4.0.1) with updated versions of mrds, dsm, DSsim and mads which have various bug fixes.\nDistance 7.3 Release 1 - Addition of a shape import wizard. Bug fixes in simulation engine. Uses latest version of R (3.5.1) with updated versions of dsm and DSsim.\nDistance 7.2 Release 1 - Mrds and dsm analyses can now be performed for point transects as well as line transects. Uses latest version of R (3.5.0) with updated versions of mrds, dsm and DSsim.\nDistance 7.1 Release 1 - Uses latest version of R (3.4.1); all R packages updated. New dsm analytical variance calculation, concurvity plot and prediction plot using ggplot2 package. Simulations now support populations that occur in clusters and other individual level covariates.\nDistance 7.0 Release 1 - the public release following the trial of beta 4 during workshops. In addition, we have added an alternative variance calculation option in dsm and point transect designs have been added to the simulation engine. The R packages mrds and dsm have also been upgraded.\nDistance 7.0 Beta 4 - now implements designs (generating multiple surveys) in the simulation engine. Fixes dsm bugs: rqgam.check is only called when appropriate, gam.check has been added to output for all dsm models, alpha value for confidence intervals is now passed to the R library. It relies on the latest version or R 3.3.1 and installs packages built under this version of R.\nDistance 7.0 Beta 3 - relies on the latest version or R 3.2.2 and installs packages built under this version of R. This seems to fix a strange bug with dsm variance calculations when an error message was being generated because object appeared to have missing components.\nDistance 7.0 Beta 2 - provides a major bug fix to the design engine.\nDistance 7.0 Alpha 1 and Distance 7.0 Beta 1 were both using the Distance 6 design properties component. If you have Distance 6 installed you would not have noticed any problems in Distance 7.0. There have been no updates to the design engine and so everything would have been functioning correctly if you succeeded in loading the design inputs page.\nDistance 7.0 Beta 1\nHere’s a brief list of new features, resolved issues and known problems in Distance 7.0 Beta 1, relative to 7.0 Alpha:\nGeneral Interface Known Problems\n- About button does not work for Windows 7\n- Designs and Simulations will not run if region or strata names that they rely on are changed.\nMA Engine\nAn option to specify which field contains species codes has been added\nThe 'cv' bug in covariate uncertainty has been fixed\nCovariate uncertainty on multiple covariates no longer causes an error\nNote that the MA engine requires that the MRDS analysis object exist in the workspace so the option to remove these objects must be switched off\nR packages (mads, mrds, dsm and DSsim) have been updated to latest versions and compiled under R 3.2.2\nSee NEWS file in the relevant packages for further information of changes and/or bug fixes\nHere's a brief list of new features, resolved issues and known problems in Distance 7.0, relative to 6.2:\nWe have made 2 major additions, the multi-analysis (MA) engine and the simulation engine. The MA analysis engine deals with unidentified sightings, covariate uncertainty and model uncertainty. The simulation engine allows you to try out different designs and see how they perform for your particular study.\nReporting problems\nTo report a new problem, please visit https://github.com/DistanceDevelopment/distance-bugs and click the 'New Issue' button or E-mail us at distance@st-andrews.ac.uk.\nAppendix 1: Files added during Distance 7 Installation\nNote - if older versions of these files are already present, they will be overwritten.

    "text": "Distance evolved from program TRANSECT. However, Distance is quite different from its predecessor as a result of changes in analysis methods and expanded capabilities. The name Distance was chosen because it can be used to analyze several forms of distance sampling data: line transect, point transect (variable circular plot) and cue-counts. By contrast TRANSECT was designed only to analyze line transect data.\nDistance versions 1.0 - 2.2 were DOS-based applications that were programmed using a relatively simple command language. Version 3.0 was a windows console application, but retained the command language structure. All of these versions were principally programmed by Jeff Laake of the National Marine Mammal Laboratory, US Fisheries Service.\nIn 1997, Steve Buckland and David Borchers, from the University of St Andrews, obtained funding from two British research councils to proceed with an ambitious three-year project to develop new distance sampling software. The new software, which became known as Distance 4, was designed to be fully windows-based, and be capable of incorporating new features such as geographic survey design, multiple covariate distance sampling models, spatial estimation of abundance, and dual observer mark-recapture line transect methods. A Distance 4 project development team was assembled, coordinated by Len Thomas. In autumn 1997, it was decided to produce an intermediate version of Distance: fully windows based, but with the same analysis capabilities as the current version 3.0. This new program, Distance 3.5, took one full year to develop, and was released in November 1998, with various updates through to February 1999. Distance 3.5 was downloaded by over 4000 users, from around 120 countries.\nExtension of Distance 3.5 to become Distance 4 began in 1999, and the software was first previewed at training workshops in summer 2000.\n\nAfter various public beta versions, Distance 4.0 was released in 2002, followed by Distance 4.1 in 2003 and Distance 5.0 in 2006. This last version had a major new feature in the form of a link to the free statistical software R, thereby facilitating a major expansion in the analytical capabilities available to Distance users.\nDistance 6.0 made use of this feature to include a new density surface modelling analysis engine, written as a library in R. Distance 6 was released in July 2009, with Distance 6.2 (containing new features and bug releases) following in May 2014.\n\nOctober 2016 brought the release of Distance 7, including the new simulation engine and multi-analysis engine. Distance 7.1 (July 2017) contained some new features; Distance 7.2 (June 2018) included the addition of point transect analyses in both MRDS and DSM; Distance 7.3 (February 2019) added a Shape Import Wizard; Distance 7.4 (May 2022) added features to analyze Camera Trap Distance Sampling data; and Distance 7.5 (September 2022) marked a switch from 32-bit to 64-bit R for the R-based engines.\n\nWe are still actively developing the software, incorporating new features and extending current ones. If you have any comments or suggestions about the program, we’d love to hear from you!\n\n\nThe below people have been involved in the development of Distance but no-longer take an active role on the team (though may still be working on distance sampling related issues).\n\nDavid R.

    "text": "What is distance sampling?\n\n\n\nDistance sampling is a widely used methodology for estimating animal density or abundance. Its name derives from the fact that the information used for inference are the recorded distances to objects of interest (usually animals) obtained by surveying lines or points. In the case of lines the perpendicular distances to detected animals are recorded, while in the case of points the radial distances from the point to detected animals are recorded. A key underlying concept is that the probability of detecting an animal decreases as its distance from the observer increases. Much of distance sampling methodology is concentrated on detection functions, which model the probability of detecting an animal, given its distance from the transect.\nThe below animation illustrates a simple line transect survey. As the observer moves along the transects (red line, showing progress along the current transect), objects are detected with a probability dependent on their distance from the observer (blue points are detected). Distances to the objects are recorded in the histogram. The histogram shows a characteristic decrease in frequency as distance increases — it is this relationship that is modelled by the detection function.\n\n\n\nAn animation showing an example of a distance sampling line transect survey, as the observer moves along lines, objects are detected and their observed distances are reflected in an updated histogram\n\n\nCode to generate the above figure may be found here.",
