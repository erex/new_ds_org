This list is for researchers and practitioners interested in the estimation of wildlife abundance using distance sampling techniques (e.g., line transects, point transects (VCPs), cue counts, etc). Discussions include survey design, analysis methods, software tools, problems and new developments.

The purpose of the list is to promote the sharing of ideas and information among researchers and practitioners interested in distance sampling techniques. Suitable topics for discussion include:

- questions about survey design and analysis
- new methodological developments
- use of software tools (program Distance and other software)
- news about up-coming meetings, workshops and conferences where distance methods will be discussed
- jobs related to distance sampling
