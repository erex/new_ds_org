An important update is that the default encounter rate variance estimator for point transect surveys has now been changed from the ‘P3’ estimator to the ‘P2’ estimator.\n\n\n\n\n\n04 Jan 2024\n\n\nLaura Marshall\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNew versions of Distance and mrds packages\n\n\n\n\n\nWe are pleased to announce the release of new versions of our R packages Distance and mrds. The new release adds the ability to fit detection functions (CDS and MCDS) using the same optimizer used by Distance for Windows.\n\n\n\n\n\n03 Aug 2023\n\n\nLen Thomas\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDesign and Simulation R packages\n\n\n\n\n\nWe would like to make you aware that our design and simulation packages (dssd and dsims) are temporarily only available from our development repository on github.\n\n\n\n\n\n12 Jan 2023\n\n\nLen Thomas\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNew versions of R packages\n\n\n\n\n\nImminent release of new versions of our R packages Distance and mrds. The information below will be particularly relevant to users of dht2. We recommend all users of these packages update to the newest versions.\n\n\n\n\n\n16 Nov 2022\n\n\nLaura Marshall\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelease of Distance 7.5\n\n\n\n\n\nRelease of a new version of Distance for Windows, Distance 7.5. This version upgrades to use 64 bit R and also contains new versions of our R packages which are also now on CRAN.\n\n\n\n\n\n07 Sep 2022\n\n\nLaura Marshall\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDistance for Windows and R 4.2\n\n\n\n\n\nUsers of Distance for Windows who make use of the analysis engines that call R - that is the MRDS, DSM and MA analysis engines. Distance for Windows currently is not compatible with the latest version of R (4.2); we suggest a workaround and announce that we will be releasing a new version of Distance for Windows in August 2022.\n\n\n\n\n\n06 Jun 2022\n\n\nLen Thomas\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNo matching items"

To download an archive file, click on its link. Once it has downloaded, execute the file to unpack it, and then see the readme file for futher instructions.\n\n\nReport a bug in Distance\nDownloads, useable with more than one version of Distance. See also the list of Other Software some of which interface with Distance and the Distance R packages.\n\nVisual interface to activity package\n\nProvides web-based access to the core functionality of the activity package in R.

You do this by copying the graph data from Distance (by clicking the copy button), pasting it into Excel, and running the macro. Distance already provides the facility to copy the plots as pictures, but these pictures can not then be edited. Using this macro, you are free to change the plot format (colors, axes, etc) as you wish.\nNote: this macro only works in Excel 97 or later - if you have an earlier version of Excel please contact Dr. Gerrodette (address is in the download’s readme).\n\nInformation and Excel macro for converting data stored as frequency of counts in different distance intervals into format required by Distance\n\nContributed by Matt Schlesinger, Aaron Ellingson , Jeremy Lindsell and others.\nThis zip file contains replies to the following email which Matt posted to the distance-sampling list in December 2004.  It also contains an Excel file with a macro for doing the job (by Aaron) and a Word document describing how to do it manually (for another similar data set, by Jeremy)\n“[…] I’m converting my bird point transect data to Distance format. We recorded birds in 25-m distance categories. The data were entered into MS Access in the following format, to match the data sheet for easy entry (each of these fields separated by commas are columns in the data table): Site, station, visit, species, 0-25, 25-50, 50-75, 75-100, &gt;100\nEach row is a combination of site, station, visit, and species, with the total number of detections within each distance category noted in the appropriate column. […] Distance requires that each detection be its own row. […] Does anyone know of a way to convert a format like mine to Distance format easily?”\n\nAny other ideas?…\n\nIf you have written a utility program that you think others would find useful in their dealings with Distance we would be happy to publish it here. Please contact us.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlthough we don’t have any direct experience, Distance should run without problems within the emulation software VMWare, win4lin, Parallels, VirtualBox, etc.  For VMWare, note that there is a free version called VMWare player, and if you search the web under something like “Free VMWare” you will find instructions about how to set up operating system images using free software (one site is http://johnbokma.com/vmware-player/). VirtualBox is opensource and supported by Oracle.  Other possibilities are to use the free emulators Bochs (pronounced “box” - slow, apparently) or QEMU (with the accelerator module).  For up to date information, try searching the web for “PC Emulators” or “PC Virtualizers”.  If you try any of these solutions, please let us know how you get on! We have one report of VirtualBox running Distance 6.0 under Ubuntu platform without trouble.\n\n\n\nFor OS X, many emulators are available - examples include Parallels and the opensource VirtualBox. If you try any of these, then let us know how they work. Parallels (v11) worked fine on OSX releases “Leopard”, “Snow Leopard”, “Lion”, “Mountain Lion”, “Mavericks” and “El Capitan” on both PowerPC and Intel Macs (thanks to Jack Lawson for providing this information). Another option, if you have an Intel-based Mac, is to use Apple’s Boot Camp software to boot into Windows.\n\n\n\nOne caveat (true of all cross-platform transfers) is that users should be careful when creating ASCII text files on other operating systems for use in Distance. They need to have the Windows carriage-return and line-feed characters at the end of each line. There are many ways to ensure this happens, and users who work under multiple operating systems will be well aware of the issue already.\n\n\n\nYou may want to use Distance command files on the command line using MCDS.exe as described in the Distance manual. This can be achieved on Linux and macOS using the Windows emulator wine on the command line. Note that DOS emulators will not work, as Windows DLLs are required. More recent versions of macOS (Catalina/10.15 onwards) have removed 32-bit support, so wine32on64 needs to be used.\n\n\n\n\n\nESRI Shapefile Technical Description (PDF). This is an white paper produced by ESRI describing the internal format of a shapefile.  It also contains some very useful information about how you should order the vertices of a polygon, for example, to create a “clean” shapefile.\nGeographic Coordinate Systems and Map Projections (PDF). This is an appendix from Samantha Strindberg’s PhD thesis (Strindberg 2001). Sam was a PhD student here at the University of St Andrews and developed the methods used in the survey design part of Distance. This appendix gives some background information about geographic coordinate systems and projections: what are they, which should you choose, etc. Hopefully it will be useful for those not familiar with this aspect of GISs.\nSpatial data handling in R cheatsheet (performs direct download) Martin Wegmann maintains a “cheatsheet” for dealing with spatial data in R.\n\n\n\n\n\nOther software"
