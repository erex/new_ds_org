Distance 7.5 is now released as the latest version in the Distance 7 release cycle. This version of Distance now runs the 64 bit R allowing users to use R versions 4.2 and up (previous versions of Distance only ran 32 bit R). We have also switched the simulation engine to use the `dsims` R package (DSsim has now been retired from CRAN). Please report any issues you encounter with this switch. The ability to run global simulations with stratified designs is once again available with Distance 7.5 release 2. 
 
Projects will now open in Distance 7.5 by default and you will be asked to "upgrade" your project when opened in Distance 7.5. See the release notes below for more information.

### Additional information

* The R libraries supplied with Distance 7.5 release 2 were compiled and tested under R version 4.2.2. We recommend you install this version of R, running Distance with older versions of R will lead to warning messages. Newer versions of R may work, but there is no guarantee of this.
* If you're having problems with using the MRDS, DSM and MA analysis engines or the simulation engine (errors regarding check that R is installed correctly or the library directory is not writable) then check [details of R installation for Distance 7.5 Release 2](http://distancesampling.org/Distance/old-versions/d75-r-install-details.html).
